## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to accurately predict loan approval outcomes based on credit scoring data. The provided code encompasses a step-by-step approach to achieve this goal.

## Data Preprocessing

The raw credit scoring data is loaded, cleaned, and missing values are handled. Unnecessary columns are removed, and columns are renamed for clarity. Invalid values are imputed, and date-related features are extracted.

## Feature Engineering

New features are created based on domain knowledge, enhancing the predictive power of the models. Adaptive binning is applied to continuous variables, and categorical variables are one-hot encoded or label encoded as appropriate.

## Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining essential information. This helps improve model efficiency and performance.

## Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

A variety of classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM are trained and evaluated. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

## Stacking Classifier

An ensemble model is created using the Stacking Classifier technique, combining the strengths of multiple base models. This final model uses LightGBM as the meta-estimator and leverages the predictions of other classifiers for improved performance.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, balanced accuracy, and ROC-AUC. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are visualized to assess model performance comprehensively.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates a systematic approach to predict loan approval outcomes through data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble learning techniques. By leveraging these methods, accurate loan approval predictions can be achieved, aiding in risk assessment and decision-making.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own credit scoring and loan approval prediction tasks.
